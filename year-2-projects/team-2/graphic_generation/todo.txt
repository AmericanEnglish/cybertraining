Python program plan.

[ ] Could use more complicated code to decide where timelag is placed: something triggy?
[ ] Color gradient - See Stackexchange post
[ ] Link with main github.

Prep:
    Map
        Read in map image.
        Get size.

    Nodes
        Read in nodes.
        Convert node locations to mapscale. (or do later?)
        Make node dictionary

    Connections
        Read in Connections
        Need nodeA, nodeB, variable(1, 2, 3, 4)

    Filter nodes to only include those with connections. (Or don't? Leave optional)

Testing:
    Check x 1,000,000
