**Title**: Deep Learning Based Mineral Dust Detection and FeatureSelection

**Team members**: Ping Hou, Peng Wu

**Mentors**: Aryya Gangopadhyay

**Abstract**: Dust storm affects human health and the environment. In this study, we develop deep learning models to identify dust from cloud and surface using MODIS observations and CALIPSO data. We also identified the best subset of channels for dust detection by a shuffling procedure and a genetic algorithm. Results show the important features determined by the two methods are very similar. And the genetic algorithm selected a subset of features that have a comparable performance with the model with all features, proving the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm. The chosen subset will reduce future data collection efforts for dust detection.
