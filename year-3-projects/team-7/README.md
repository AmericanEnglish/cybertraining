**Abstract**: 
Dust and sandstorms originating from Earthâ€™s major arid and semi-arid desert areas can significantly affect the climate system and health. Many existing methods use heuristic rules to classify on a pixel-level regarding dust or dust-free, but these heuristic rules are limited in applicability when the study area or the study period is changed. Based on the multi-sensor collocation dataset generated from CyberTraining 2019, we sought to utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect and segment dust in multispectral satellite imagery. 

**Structures of implementation**:

1.download_viirs_samples.py: use collocated calipso-viirs dataset to download VIIRS granule based on filename

Experiments using 256 by 256 pixels subsets of VIIRS imagery collocating with CALIPSO tracks:

2.cal_pixel_label_256.py: generate 256 by 256 images/data: mask, predictor, figure, composite, and landtype

3.kmeans_one_image.py: use K-means clustering to cluster one image within the test set

4.kmeans_average_accuracy.py: use kmeans clustering method to cluster all images within the test set and calculate average accuracy

Experiments using the entire subsets of VIIRS imagery collocating with CALIPSO tracks:

5.test_entire_granule.py: experiment test on a VIIRS-CALIPSO granule subset from extracting data, K-means, accuracy evaluation in one python code
