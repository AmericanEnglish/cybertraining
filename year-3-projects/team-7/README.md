**Abstract**: 
Dust and sandstorms originating from Earthâ€™s major arid and semi-arid desert areas can significantly affect the climate system and health. Many existing methods use heuristic rules to classify on a pixel-level regarding dust or dust-free, but these heuristic rules are limited in applicability when the study area or the study period is changed. Based on the multi-sensor collocation dataset generated from CyberTraining 2019, we sought to utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect and segment dust in multispectral satellite imagery.
