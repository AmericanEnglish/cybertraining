**Abstract**: 
Clouds are inherently 3D, and simulating radiative transfer (RT) properties accurately requires models that take their 3D effects into account. Because 3D models are complex and computationally expensive, RT models often use simplified 1D models to retrieve cloud properties, which suffer from inaccuracies due to 3D effects. Recent advancements in deep learning may lead to a retrieval algorithm that is capable of taking these effects into account. We will develop a deep-learning based cloud property retrieval algorithm that is able to reconstruct the 3D structure of clouds based on observed cloud radiative signatures.
