Make_ice_table calculates the shortwave single scattering properties of
gamma distributions of one of eight shapes of ice crystals and outputs
the results in a scattering table.  The ice crystal scattering properties
were produced by Ping Yang and are described in this article:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Yang, Ping,  K. N. Liou, Klaus Wyser, David Mitchell, 2000:
   Parameterization of the scattering and absorption properties of
   individual ice crystals.  J. Geophys. Res., 105 (D4), 4699-4718.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 The scattering properties are tabulated for 56 wavelength bands from
0.20 to 5.0 microns and 24 particle lengths from 3 to 3500 microns. The
eight ice crystal shapes are 1=hollow column, 2=solid column, 3=plate,
4=dendrite, 5=rough aggregate, 6=smooth aggregate, 7=4-bullet rosette,
and 8=6-bullet rosette (see the article for pictures of these shapes).

The phase functions have been modified for this distribution by 
convolving the portions with scattering angles less than 10 degrees by a
gaussian with 0.25 degree rms width and by adjusting the forward peak
height to normalize each phase function.  The reasons for doing this is
that the original phase functions with the largest size parameters would
require a huge number of Legendre series terms to be represented for
SHDOM and also were not properly normalized.  The number of Legendre
terms required for the smoothed forward peak phase functions is 2500.
The smoothing of the forward peak will not affect the radiative transfer
results significantly for nearly all applications (one application where
it could be an issue is sun photometry, but the TMS approximation in
SHDOM is already poor for that application).

These phase functions do not contain the "delta transmission", which is
the direct transmission of rays through parallel faces of ice crystals.
The extinction efficiency, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry
parameter have thus been delta rescaled to be consistent.  This reduces
the extinction efficiency, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry
parameter from the values in Ping Yang's original data.  The extinction
efficiency is well below 2 for crystals with parallel faces, such as   
plates and solid columns.

The modified Ping Yang ice scattering data is stored in the file
"sw_ice_scatter.db".  This ascii file contains a header with useful
information, followed by the data with one line per particle shape,
wavelength, and particle size.  Each line contains the following
columns:

The log of the phase function values are stored in three digit base 95
(there are 95 printable characters in ascii).  If the three characters
of the base 95 number are represented by Cn (i.e. C1,C2,C3) then the
base 95 digits are Dn=ICHAR(Cn)-32, and the phase function value are
10**(10*(D1/95+D2/95**2+D3/95**3)-4).  This helps to compress the 
original 152 million bytes of ice scattering data down to only 10
millions bytes.

Make_ice_table reads the "sw_ice_scatter.db" database file to produce a
scattering table file for gamma size distributions with a sequence of
effective radii for one particle shape (i.e. it does not allow particle
mixtures).  The single scattering properties are averaged over the
specified wavelength range using a solar temperature (5800 K) Planck
function weighting.  The program prints out the database bands and
weightings that are used.  The gamma distributions are in terms of the
equivalent volume spherical diameter (Dv), not the particle length.  The
"b" parameter of the gamma distribution [n(D) = a Dv^alpha exp(-b*Dv)]
is adjusted iteratively to achieve the correct effective radius.  The
effective radius is defined as one half the ratio of the third moment of
Dv to the second moment of Da (the equivalent area spherical diameter).
The user specified effective radius may not be achievable for a
particular particle shape and size distribution width, in which case a
different range of effective radius or a narrower distribution (larger
alpha) will have to be chosen.  The extinction in the output scattering
table is normalized for distributions with an ice water content of      
1 g/m^3 assuming an ice density of 0.916 g/cm^3.
