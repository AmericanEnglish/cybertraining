<H2>MAKE_MIE_TABLE </H2>

Make_mie_table calculates the single scattering properties of gamma or
lognormal distributions of spherical particles and outputs the results
in a scattering table.  If the particle type is water or ice then an
integration across the specified wavelength band may be performed.  If
an aerosol particle type is chosen then the index of refraction of the
aerosol is specified.
<P>

For water or ice particles an integration across the wavelength range
may be done.  In this case a series of Mie calculations are performed at
a specified wavelength spacing using the correct index of refraction for
each wavelength.  The alternative is to use the Planck function averaged
index of refraction and central wavelength, which takes less computation
but may be less accurate (depending on the spectral band width).  For
solar wavelengths (< 3 um) the Planck function is for a solar
temperature (5800 K), for longwave wavelengths (> 5 um) the Planck
function is for an atmospheric temperature (270 K), while between 3 and
5 um a straight average is used.
<P>

If an aerosol particle type is chosen then the particle bulk density of
the aerosol is specified.  The density is needed because the output
scattering table extinction is normalized for a mass content of 1 g/m^3.

The gamma distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r)
 where r is the droplet radius, and a, b, alpha specify the gamma
distribution.  The number concentration of droplets is 
 N = a Gamma(alpha+1)/ b^(alpha+1), where Gamma is the gamma function.
The effective radius of the distribution is r_eff = (alpha+3)/b, while
the effective variance is v_eff = 1/(alpha+3).  A typical value for 
water clouds is v_eff=0.1 or alpha=7.  For ice clouds a typical value is
alpha=1 or 2.  An exponential distribution is obtained with alpha=0.  A
large value of alpha gives close to a monodisperse distribution.
<P>

The lognormal distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a/r exp( -[ln(r/r0)]^2 / (2*sigma^2) )
 where r0 is the logarithmic mode of the distribution and sigma is the
standard deviation of the log.  The number concentration of droplets is
N = sqrt(2*pi)*sigma*a.  The effective radius of the distribution is
r_eff = r0*exp(2.5*sigma^2) and the effective variance of the
distribution is v_eff = exp(sigma^2)-1.  A common value for water clouds
is sigma=.35, or v_eff=0.130, and a common value for aerosol distributions
is sigma=0.7.
<P>

The maximum radius of the distribution is specified by the user because
it is the critical determinant of the Mie calculation computer time.
There are often microphysical reasons for truncating the theoretical
size distribution; for example, one might say that the cloud droplet
mode ends at a radius of 50 microns.  For a narrow gamma distribution
(alpha=7) of cloud droplets, a maximum radius of only twice the largest
effective radius gives virtually the same optical properties as the 
untruncated gamma distribution.  For a wide lognormal distribution, as
might be used for an aerosol distribution, a much larger maximum radius
relative to the largest effective radius would be required if no
truncation was desired.  If there is truncation make_mie_table uses an
iterative procedure to adjust the size distribution modal radius to
achieve the desired effective radius.  Thus one can be assured that the
size distributions have the effective radii reported in the output
scattering table even if there is truncation of the theoretical
distribution.  The number and spacing of the integration steps over the
size distribution is controlled by the GET_NSIZE and GET_SIZES
subroutines.  The default formula is DELX = max(0.01,0.03*X**0.5),
where X is the size parameter (2*pi*r/lambda, lambda=wavelength)
and DELX is the integration step.  This integration spacing is
adequate for most purposes, but can be easily changed if higher
accuracy is sought.
