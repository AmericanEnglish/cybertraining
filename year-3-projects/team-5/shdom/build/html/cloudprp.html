<H2>CLOUDPRP </H2>

Cloudprp prepares SHDOM properties files for 3D cloud fields.  The cloud
field is input with a 3D grid of liquid water content and (optionally)
droplet effective radius.  A tabulated phase function property file for
a particular wavelength is produced using Mie scattering from gamma
distributions or lognormal distributions of cloud droplets. The cloud
layer may occupy only part of the output domain, in which case the other
height levels are specified.  A vertical profile of horizontally uniform
aerosol scattering may be specified.  The aerosol properties (0.55 um
extinction, effective radius, distribution width, and index of
refraction at 0.55 um and the desired wavelenth) are input from a file
as a function of height.  The aerosol optical properties are calculated
with Mie theory and molecular Rayleigh scattering is included.

There are two modes of operation to cloudprp.  One is for making a Mie
scattering table of cloud optical properties.  The other mode is to use
a Mie table to produce an SHDOM property file.  Because the Mie
computations are time consuming it is useful to save these scattering
tables.  A Mie table lists the scattering properties (extinction,
single scattering albedo, Legendre series coefficients for the phase
function) as a function of droplet effective radius for a particular
wavelength and gamma distribution width parameter.  The table is
made for a liquid water content of 1 g/m^3 and is easily scaled to
other LWCs.

Although the Mie calculations are done for a single wavelength, the 
wavelength range for a band is input.  This is for performing a spectral
integration across a band using a k-distribution for molecular
absorption.  If a range of wavelengths are input then the central
wavelength is chosen by a weighted average using a Planck function.
For solar wavelengths (< 4 um) the Planck function is for a solar
temperature (5800 K), while for longer wavelengths an atmospheric
temperature (270 K) is used.  A weighted averaged is similarly done to
define the band averaged index of refraction.  The PARTTYPE='A' option
allow one to make Mie tables and property files with a user specified
index of refraction, such as for dirty cloud droplets, aerosols, etc.
<P>

The gamma distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r)
 where r is the droplet radius, and a, b, alpha specify the gamma
distribution.  The number concentration of droplets is 
 N = a Gamma(alpha+1)/ b^(alpha+1), where Gamma is the gamma function.
The effective radius of the distribution is r_eff = (alpha+3)/b, while
the effective variance is v_eff = 1/(alpha+3).  A typical value for 
water clouds is v_eff=0.1 or alpha=7.  For ice clouds a typical value
is alpha=1.  An exponential distribution is obtained with alpha=0.  
A large value of alpha gives close to a monodisperse distribution.
<P>

The lognormal distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a/r exp( -[ln(r/r0)]^2 / (2*sigma^2) )
 where r0 is the logarithmic mode of the distribution and sigma is the
standard deviation of the log.  The number concentration of droplets is
N = sqrt(2*pi)*sigma*a.  The effective radius of the distribution is
r_eff = r0*exp(2.5*sigma^2) and the effective variance of the
distribution is v_eff = exp(sigma^2)-1.  A common value for water clouds
is sigma=.35, or v_eff=0.130.
<P>

The cloud optical properties depend on the index of refraction and the
gamma distribution of cloud droplets.  The index of refraction of either
water or ice is obtained from subroutines in the program and averaged
over the wavelength range as described above.  The width parameter of
the gamma distribution, alpha, is given in the Mie table.  The other
parameters of the gamma distribution are determined from the cloud
liquid water content and the effective radius.  These are either both
specified in the cloud LWC file or determined from the LWC.  If only the
LWC is in the cloud file then the droplet number concentration is
assumed to be constant and the effective radius is calculated.
<P>

In order to save computing time, the integration over the droplet size
distribution does not fully resolve the Mie scattering function. For
large size parameters this may cause some small spurious wiggles on the
phase function.  If these bother you, then change the spacing (DELX)
in MAKE_MIE_TABLE.  Also the Mie code used does not determine if
an integration point lands on a resonance spike, and so there is
a small chance that this could effect the results in a minor
way for nonabsorbing wavelengths.
<P>

The number of Legendre series terms needed for the phase function
depends on the effective size parameter (x_eff = 2 pi r_eff/lambda) of
the droplet size distribution.  For visible wavelengths more than 1000
terms may be needed for a fully converged series.  For some radiative
transfer applications (outputting only fluxes in solar or for any
thermal radiative transfer) a truncation of the series may be desired.
The MAXTABLEG and MAXOUTLEG input parameters allow one to control
how many Legendre terms are output.
<P>

Rayleigh scattering coefficient:  The molecular scattering coefficient
depends on the air density.  Hence for a particular solar wavelength
band a coefficient (k) may be defined which gives the extinction from
the air pressure (p) and temperature (T):  ext = k p/T.  The Rayleigh
scattering coefficient input to cloudprp may be derived from the
molecular Rayleigh scattering optical depth.  The Rayleigh optical depth
at sea level as a function of wavelength (lambda in micron) is <BR>
 &nbsp &nbsp tau = 0.0088*lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda) <BR>
From this formula the cloudprp Rayleigh input coefficient is <BR>
 &nbsp &nbsp  k = (2.97E-4 K mb^-1 km^-1) lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
<P>

Typically the high resolution cloud field occupies only small portion of
the atmospheric profile and the other height levels are used to fill in
the rest of the atmosphere. The other height levels should be chosen
according to the needs of SHDOM, the aerosol profile, and the molecular
absorption profile.  SHDOM needs some vertical resolution to resolve the
radiance field.  If aerosols or molecular Rayleigh scattering are
significant, then the other levels must exist in clear sky to put that
scattering in the property file.  Similarly, if a k-distribution file is
giving the molecular absorption, then other levels must cover the range
where the absorption is significant. For example, stratospheric levels
need to be included for ozone absorption in the visible.


     <H4>   Cloud LWC File </H4>

The cloud LWC file specifies the three-dimensional distribution of 
cloud liquid water content (g/m^3) and (optionally) the droplet
effective radius (micron).  There are thus two types of cloud LWC
files: 1 parameter and 2 parameter files.  The cloud LWC file is
an ascii text file with the following format;
<PRE>
   type         [1 or 2, for LWC only or LWC and Reff]
   Nx Ny Nz     [number of X, Y, Z grid points]
   delX delY    [X and Y grid spacing in km]
   Z1 ... Zn    [heights of cloud levels in km]
   T1 ... Tn    [temperatures in Kelvin]
  IX IY IZ LWC        [for 1 parameter file, for each grid point]
    . . .
  IX IY IZ LWC Reff   [for 2 parameter file]
    . . .
</PRE>
See the "les2y21.lwc" file in the distribution for an example cloud LWC file.


 <H4>  Aerosol Property File  </H4>

The aerosol property file specifies the (usually coarse) vertical
distribution of aerosol properties.  Simply input 'NONE' for the aerosol
file name if no aerosols are desired.  There must be at least two levels
in the file.  The format is ascii text with the following columns:
<PRE>
   Height,  Extinction,  Eff. Radius,  alpha/sigma, Index of refraction
            at 0.55 um                              at 0.55 um and wavelenth
    (km)     (km^-1)      (micron)
</PRE>

The levels must be increasing in height.  The aerosol extinction and
single scattering albedo are interpolated between the input levels. The
aerosol input level closest to the property file level is chosen for the
combined aerosol/Rayleigh phase function.  Property file heights outside
the aerosol file range use the closest (first or last) aerosol level.
The aerosol distribution width parameter is either "alpha" for a gamma
distribution or "sigma" for a lognormal distribution (same as for the
the cloud input described before).
<P>
  The index of refraction and effective radius of the aerosols depends
on their composition (e.g. sea salt, mineral, sulfate), degree of
hydration, and wavelength.
<P>
 An example aerosol file is given below (it has a total 0.55 micron
optical depth of 0.4): 
<PRE>
   0.0   0.10   0.9  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
   2.0   0.10   0.9  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
   4.0   0.02   0.6  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
  12.0   0.00   0.6  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
</PRE>
 Note that this calculation is for a more absorbing wavelength, for
which the imaginary part of the index of refraction is larger than at
0.55 microns.
