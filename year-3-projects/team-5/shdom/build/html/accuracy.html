<H2>SHDOM: Accuracy Issues</H2>

   Like all numerical solutions to the radiative transfer equation, the 
operation of SHDOM entails a tradeoff between computational speed and 
accuracy.  One difference between 1D and 3D radiative transfer is that
it is very expensive to get very high accuracy (better than 1%) in 3D.
This is a result of the five dimensional nature of the problem. This is
also the case for Monte Carlo methods, but it is worse for explicit 
radiative transfer methods.  The strategy issues for running SHDOM
involve how to achieve a required accuracy in a minimum CPU time. 
<P>

    The grid spacing needed is determined by some assumptions of SHDOM:
1) the variation in the extinction and the product of the source
function and extinction across a grid cell is linear, 2) the source
function across a grid face is accurately interpolated with the bilinear
method, and 3) the radiance across a grid face is accurately
interpolated with the bilinear method.   The first and second
assumptions should be satisfied by the source function based adaptive
cell splitting algorithm, and also would be by having the optical depth
across the grid cells small compared to one.  The third assumption is
satisfied by not using too coarse a base grid, and probably only matters
as it affects the computation of the source function.  It can make sense
to have a coarse base grid where there is little scattering (clear sky),
but then the output fluxes in those regions will be of low accuracy,
though the output radiances (computed by tracing back) will be good.
Because the accuracy can be compromised if the optical depth across a
grid cell is too large, a warning is given if the property grid has
cells with optical depth larger than 2. It is the internal grid that
matters, but most people have the same grid so the check is done there. 
There are pathological cases in which a completely erroneous solar
radiative transfer solution can occur if the optical depth across the
cloud top grid cell is very large.
<P>

    The accuracy is also determined by the angular resolution, specified
by the number of discrete ordinates (NMU and NPHI). To a lesser degree
the adaptive spherical harmonic truncation parameter SHACC also
determines the angular resolution.  Most of the benefit from the
adaptive truncation occurs for low values of SHACC, so it is recommended
to keep this parameter small.  A value of SHACC=0 still gives the
benefit of not allocating source function spherical harmonic terms where
there is no scattering.  Then NMU and NPHI will determine the angular
resolution.  The angular resolution needed depends on the desired
output: for solar beam problems, net flux convergence (heating rates)
requires the least, followed by hemispheric fluxes, and then radiances. 
For heating rates Nmu=8, Nphi=16 is enough, for hemispheric fluxes
Nmu=8, Nphi=16 is often adequate, and radiances may need Nmu=16,
Nphi=32 or more depending on the phase function.
<P>

    Choosing the cell splitting accuracy: Remember that the adaptive 
parameters are in absolute units, not relative!  The actual accuracy is
not linearly related to the cell splitting accuracy.  The cell splitting
accuracy usually should be set substantially higher than the desired
absolute flux accuracy.  Look at the examples in the journal paper
for guidance.
<P>

   The only sure way to know how to set the spatial and angular
resolution is to test how the desired solution behaves with increasing
resolution, or make selected comparisons with an independent radiative
transfer method.  It is not useful to increase the angular and spatial
accuracy much beyond one another.  Tests have shown that the accuracy is
not controlled by the cell splitting accuracy alone; both the base grid
(NX,NY,NZ) and the splitting accuracy (SPLITACC) have to be considered. 
Thus, setting the splitting accuracy so small that there are many more 
adaptive grid points than base grid points, will probably not achieve
any higher accuracy.

    Unlike for plane-parallel situations, the delta-M method does not
assure high accuracy for downwelling solar flux in 2D and 3D as it does
for 1D, thus the distribution of downwelling solar flux may not be
accurate for highly peaked phase functions unless high angular
resolution is used.  This is because in 3D, sharp variations in the
extinction field mean that the downwelling solar flux is not averaged
over all angles in the same way as for a uniform medium. This limitation
appears to not affect upwelling flux, upwelling radiance, or heating
rates.
<P>

    Because of the thresholding nature of the cell splitting and the
spherical harmonic truncation, very small changes in the inputs can
amplify into larger changes in the output results.  For example, running
the same case on different machines can lead to noticeably different
results.  These variations, however, should be within the overall
accuracy of the results governed by the angular and spatial resolution.
<P>

    Upwelling hemispheric fluxes are slightly more accurately computed
by using the double Gaussian quadrature discrete ordinate set.  This is
choosen by setting ORDINATESET=3 in SOLVE_RTE.  With this option,
radiances, heating rates, and net fluxes may be slightly less accurate.
