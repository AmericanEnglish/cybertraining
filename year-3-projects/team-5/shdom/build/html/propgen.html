<H2>PROPGEN </H2>

Propgen generates an optical property file for SHDOM from a particle
property file specifying the 3D distribution of mass content and
effective radius for several types of particles.  The optical properties
for these particle types are specified in scattering table files.  The
optical properties are interpolated in effective radius within the
scattering tables (logarithmically for extinction and linearly for
single scattering albedo and phase function).  The extinction and
single scattering albedo for the mixture specified at each grid point
are calculated exactly.  The phase functions for the mixtures are
approximate, however, because there is not enough memory to store a
phase function for each grid point.  Instead, the closest phase function
to the correct one is used.  If none of the phase functions in the
scattering tables are within the user specified tolerances then the new
mixture phase function is added to the list.  Tolerances are specified
for the asymmetry parameter and the maximum fractional error in phase
function values.
<P>

There are three parameters that control the creation of new phase
functions.  The first is the maximum number of phase functions that may
be created, which is designed to limit the memory use by SHDOM.  The
second and third parameters are the tolerance in asymmetry parameter
error and the tolerance in maximum fractional error in phase function
values.  The maximum fractional phase function error is calculated at 90
angles from 2 to 180 degrees, but this can be changed by changing the
 "INTEGER, PARAMETER :: NANGLES=90" statement in propgen.f90.  Smaller
values of the two tolerances will produce a more accurate property file,
but at the expense of a larger number of phase functions.  If the
property file is to be used only for flux computations then the
asymmetry parameter tolerance is most important and the fractional phase
function tolerance can be set large.  If the property file is to be
used for radiance calculations then the fractional error in phase
function tolerance is more important.  If you are outputting a
one-dimensional property file, then you can set the tolerances to zero
to get one phase function for each output level (actually the program
has minimum values of 0.002 for the asymmetry parameter tolerance and
0.01 for the fractional phase function tolerance).  Propgen only outputs
the phase functions actually used in the property file, not all the ones
in the scattering tables (like cloudprp did).  If 1000 or more phase 
functions are going to be output then the format statement in subroutine
OUTPUT_PROPERTIES will need to be changed.
<P>

In addition to the scattering properties from the input particles,
propgen also calculates and includes molecular Rayleigh scattering.  The
use specifies a Rayleigh scattering coefficient, which depends on
wavelength (or the user may wish to simply set to zero for some
applications).  The amount of molecular scattering depends on the air
density.  Hence for a particular solar wavelength band a coefficient (k)
may be defined which gives the extinction from the air pressure (p) and
temperature (T):  ext = k p/T.  The Rayleigh scattering coefficient
input to propgen may be derived from the molecular Rayleigh scattering
optical depth.  The Rayleigh optical depth at sea level as a function of
wavelength (lambda in micron) is 
    tau = 0.0088*lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
From this formula the propgen Rayleigh input coefficient is
    k = (2.97E-4 K mb^-1 km^-1) lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
Propgen uses the hypsometric relation to calculate the pressure profile
from the input temperature profile.
<P>

Typically the high resolution cloud field occupies only small portion of
the atmospheric profile and the other height levels are used to fill in
the rest of the atmosphere.  The other height levels should be chosen
according to the needs of SHDOM and the molecular absorption profile. 
SHDOM needs some vertical resolution to resolve the radiance field.  If
molecular Rayleigh scattering is significant, then the other levels
must exist in clear sky to put that scattering in the property file. 
Similarly, if a k-distribution file is giving the molecular absorption,
then other levels must cover the range where the absorption is
significant.  For example, stratospheric levels need to be included for
ozone absorption in the ultraviolet.

               <h4> Particle Properties File </h4>

The particle file specifies the three-dimensional distribution of mass
content (g/m^3) and effective radius (microns) for each component type
of particle.  Only the the particle types with nonzero mass content need
to be specified at each grid point.  The particle file is an ascii text
file with the following format:
 <pre>
   3            [format type]
   Nx Ny Nz     [number of X, Y, Z grid points]
   delX delY    [X and Y grid spacing in km]   
   Z1 ... Zn    [heights of particle levels in km]
   T1 ... Tn    [temperatures in Kelvin at these levels]
   IX IY IZ  Numcomp  Type1 Mass1 Reff1 ... TypeN MassN ReffN
    . . .
</pre>
 Numcomp is the number of particle components, Type? are the type
numbers of the components, Mass? are the mass contents [g/m^3] of the
components, and Reff? are the effective radii [microns] of the
components.  See file "nauru19990707.part" in the distribution for an
example particle file.  In addition to this new particle file format,
propgen can read the old 2 parameter LWC files that cloudprp used.
<P>

             <h4> Scattering Table Format </h4>

The scattering tables have a six line header.  Propgen only reads the
wavelength range in the second header line and the number of effective
radii on the sixth header line.  After the header, for each effective
radius entry in a scattering table, there is one line with the effective
radius, the volume extinction coefficient (km^-1 for a mass content of 1
g/m^3), the single scattering albedo, and the order (Nleg) of the
Legendre series of the phase function.  The next line or several lines
contain the Nleg+1 Legendre series coefficients, starting with chi0
(which must be equal to 1).  For an example scattering table, see one
of the scattering table files produced by the example script.  Propgen
can read the Mie tables produced by cloudprp if the wavelength range is
put in the second line (instead of just the central wavelength) using a
text editor.
