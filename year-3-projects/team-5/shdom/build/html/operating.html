<H2>SHDOM: Operating Strategy</H2>

    The first step is to compile the code.  A makefile is provided, with
options to compile with or without MPI (for multiple processors) and
with or without the netcdf library.  SHDOM was written in Fortran 77
with common extensions.  Later a Fortran 90  main program, shdom90.f90,
was written to replace the Fortran 77 driver, shdom.f.  The Fortran 90
version uses allocatable arrays and frees the user from having to set
most of the parameters controlling the array sizes.  
<P>

    While a few algorithm and coding bugs may be left in the code, the
most common source of errors is incorrect input.  Be sure to check the
input parameters against the documentation and the USER_INPUT routine.
The correctness of the input property file format can be found by using
the 'M' - medium property output option.  There are routines that
check the input parameters and property file for validity and issue
warnings for common mistakes.
<P>
    Conservation of energy can be used as a check for conservatively
scattering medium, but remember that the multiple reflections between 
the surface and medium will introduce "extra" flux.  The collimated 
(solar) flux input parameter is the flux on a horizontal surface 
(rather than the flux perpendicular to the beam), so for conservative 
scattering and no surface reflection the reflected plus transmitted 
flux over the domain should equal this parameter.
<P>
    The delta-M scaling procedure is very useful for reducing the
angular resolution needed.  It is generally used for collimated (solar)
source problems.  One should remember that the delta-M scaling procedure
changes the extinction, single scattering albedo, and Legendre phase
function fields, as can be seen with the medium output option.  This
means that the direct solar flux is increased with delta-M scaling and
must be added to the diffuse transmitted flux for meaningful results.
<P>
    For putting in the rest of the atmosphere: a coarse grid outside the
cloud region works because the rest of the atmosphere does not interact
much with the cloud layer (little reflection back to the cloud layer).
The fluxes, which depend on the cell-to-cell discrete ordinate
integration, will not be as reliable above the cloud level.  The
radiances, however, which are computed by integrating the source
function back all the way to the boundary will be fine at any level.

         <H3> Output during Iterations </H3>

    During the iterations some useful information is output to stdout.
Six terms are output on a line each iteration:
 <OL>
  <LI> Iterations, 
  <LI> Log10(solution criterion),
  <LI> Cell splitting criterion,  
  <LI> Number of grid points,
  <LI> Average number of SH terms, 
  <LI> Ratio of number of SH terms to total possible
 </OL>

    Using these parameters you can track the convergence towards the
solution and the behavior of the adaptive grid process.  As the current
cell splitting accuracy parameter is reduced the number of grid points
increases and the cell splitting criterion decreases. The cell splitting
criterion is the maximum over the whole medium.  The adaptive spherical
harmonic truncation may also be monitored with the average number of SH
terms.
<P>
    The solution criterion often does not converge monotonically.  When
the cell splitting accuracy parameter is lowered and many adaptive cells
are created the solution criterion typically increases.  The sequence
acceleration method may cause the solution criterion to increase at a
particular step, though the overall convergence is usually speeded.  The
adaptive spherical harmonic truncation (parameter SHACC) may also
interfer with a smooth convergence.  If you have trouble with
convergence try adusting one of these parameters (SPLITACC, SHACC,
ACCEL).
