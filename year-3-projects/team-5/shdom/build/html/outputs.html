<H2>SHDOM: Output Formats</H2>


    The output goes to a number of plain text files (except for the
visualization and netcdf output), each containing a header listing the
input parameters.  The header also lists the number of iterations taken,
which for a k-distribution is the total number over the distribution
sum.  There are seven output types:   
 <UL>
  <LI> R - radiance,
  <LI> V - visualization,
  <LI> F - hemispheric flux,
  <LI> H - net flux convergence (heating rate),
  <LI> S - spherical harmonic output,
  <LI> J - source function, and
  <LI> M - medium properties.
 </UL>
Any number of ascii files maybe output during a single run.  
<P>

A single netcdf output file may be specified in addition to, or instead
of, the ascii output files.  The netcdf file contains all the output
types of the specified ascii files.  If the ascii files are not desired,
then use NONE for each of the ascii file names.  The output in the
netcdf file is arranged somewhat differently from the ascii files.  For
all of the output on a grid, X is the fastest moving index, and Z is the
slowest.  The total downward flux and downward diffuse flux are output,
rather than the downward diffuse and direct flux separately, as in the
ascii files.  Only those output formats allowed with multiple processors
are supported in the netcdf output.  Specifically, the V, J, and M
formats are not supported, nor is the F 2 format, nor any output on the
adaptive grid (i.e. F, H, and S outputs are only on the base grid).  All
of the information in the header of the ascii files is included as
global attributes in the netcdf file.  The netcdf output requires using
the Fortran 90 driver (shdom90.f90).  The shdom_netcdf module was
written by Robert Pincus (December 2008).
<P>

The radiance output computes the radiance at a single vertical level for
a regular grid of locations for a series of directions.  There are two
visualization output modes, both of which make PDS format images. The
first one simulates a fixed position camera, while the second simulates
a cross track scanning instrument flying on an airplane.  For the camera
mode the inputs are the position and pointing direction of the camera,
the number of pixels vertically and horizontally, and the pixel spacing.
For the cross track scanning mode the inputs are the starting and ending
aircraft positions, the distance along track beween scans, and the range
of scan angles (<0 for left side, > 0 for right side).  The PDS image
format has a human readable ascii header followed by the pixel values in
straight binary format (from left to right and then top to the bottom of
the image).  The pixel format may be byte (values 0 to 255) or two byte
integers (values -32768 to 32767).  PDS format byte images may be viewed
with "xv" on some Unix systems and an IDL program, pdstojpeg.pro, is
provided to convert the PDS images to JPEG format.
<P>

  There are several ways to output hemispheric flux, including and the top
and bottom of the domain, on a regular horizontal grid at any level, or
for every grid point.  The net flux convergence may be output for each
grid point or for a domain averaged vertical profile.  The spherical
harmonic output is the mean  radiance and net flux vector (proportional
to the first 4 terms in the spherical harmonic expansion) and for solar
problems includes the direct beam contribution.
 The source function output lists the extinction and source function
computed for a specified direction at every grid point. This can be
useful for use by another program such as to compute limb  radiances in
a spherical geometry.  The medium properties output lists  the
(potentially delta-M scaled) extinction, single scattering albedo, 
asymmetry parameter, and temperature at the grid points, and is useful 
for making sure the medium was input correctly.
<P>

    There is a debugging output file format containing GLE graphics
commands to draw the grid cells and arrows showing the neighboring cell
relationships for an XZ plane. If this is desired, comment in the call
to VISUALIZE_CELLS after the solution iteration loop.
