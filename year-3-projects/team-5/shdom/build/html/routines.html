<H2>SHDOM: List of Routines</H2>

<PRE>
    The following is a list of all the subroutines, where they are, and
what they do.  The first column gives the file (0 is shdom.f/shdom90.f90, 
1 is shdomsub1.f, 2 is shdomsub2.f, 3 is shdomsub3.f, M is shdom_mpi.f90,
F is fftpack.f).  The second column indicates the calling routine.  The
major solving  routines are in shdomsub1.f, other routines are in
shdomsub2.f, all the regular I/O routines are in shdomsub3.f, the MPI
calling routines are in shdom_mpi.f90, and fftpack.f has the FFTPACK 
routines from NCAR.
