<H2>SHDOM Correlated k-Distribution Programs</H2>


Three k-distribution programs are distributed with SHDOM to include the
effects of molecular absorption in a broadband spectral integration. 
These programs read one atmospheric profile file (with pressure,
temperature, water vapor, and ozone profiles) and produce an SHDOM CKD
file.  An SHDOM CKD file contains absorption coefficient profiles for
each "k" in each spectral band in the k-distribution, along with some
other information (see shdom.txt).  The example Unix script
run_kdist_les has examples of using CKD programs, the wavenumber and
wavelength ranges of the spectral bands, and the Rayleigh molecular
scattering coefficients for each band (input to propgen).
<P>

Two of the programs, <tt>ckdlwrrtm</tt> and <tt>ckdswrrtm</tt>, are
derived from the longwave and shortwave Rapid Radiative Transfer Models
(RRTM) developed at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc,
principally by Eli Mlawer (see <tt>http://www.rtweb.aer.com</tt>). The
longwave CKD program is from the original RRTM version, not the new
version first released in 2002. The longwave RRTM reference is:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Mlawer, E.J., S.J. Taubman, P.D. Brown,  M.J. Iacono and S.A. Clough:
   RRTM, a validated correlated-k model for the longwave. 
   J. Geophys. Res., 102, 16,663-16,682, 1997 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 Both the longwave and shortwave CKD programs do not exactly  match the
original RRTM algorithms because the SHDOM k-distribution model is
different.  The SHDOM model is that the temperature profile and
scattering properties are independent of the "k" within each spectral
band.  The radiative transfer results based on <tt>ckdlwrrtm</tt> and
<tt>ckdswrrtm</tt> do agree closely with the RRTM programs (fluxes
within 1 - 2 W/m^2).    <P>

The third program, <tt>ckdfu</tt>, makes an SHDOM CKD file for both the
shortwave and longwave, and is derived from Fu and Liou's original
correlated k-distribution described in the article:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Fu, Qiang and K. N. Liou, 1992: On the Correlated k-Distribution 
   Method for Radiative Transfer in Nonhomogeneous Atmospheres. 
   J. Atmos. Sci., 49, 2139-2156.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
This version is not the much upgraded "Fu and Liou" k-distribution used
by the CERES program at NASA Langley.  This older k-distribution
parameterization has a number of deficiencies, including using one band
for the ultraviolet and the visible, using the outdated Roberts et al.
(1976) water vapor continuum, and missing trace absorbing species.  Thus
it is considerably less accurate than the RRTM based programs, however,
it is substantially cheaper to run because it has fewer k's, and is
appropriate for some theoretical experiments (e.g. where differences
between SHDOM runs are being investigated).  The size of the
k-distributions in the three programs is summarized below.

The number of k's is the total number of monochromatic radiative
transfer calculations that SHDOM must perform across the longwave or
shortwave.



             <H4> Input Parameters </H4>

The inputs are the same for all three CKD programs.

             <H4> Atmospheric File Format </H4>

The atmospheric file specifies the profile of temperature, pressure,
water vapor and ozone.  Each row of the file contains an atmospheric
level, starting at the top of the atmosphere and ending at the surface.
As an example, the US standard atmosphere is included in the SHDOM
distribution (usatm.dat).  The format is ascii text with six columns:
<PRE>
  Height  Pressure  Temperature  Air_density  Vapor_density  Ozone_density
   (km)     (mb)       (K)        (g/m^3)        (g/m^3)        (g/m^3)      
</PRE>

<P>

                  <H4> CKD Output File </H4>

There are three sections of the output file.
<OL>
 <LI> The band information: number of bands and for each band
   the wavenumber range (cm^-1), solar flux (W/m^2), 
   number of g's (or k's), and delta g values (weights).
 <LI> The atmosphere information: the concentration of CO2, CH4, N2O,
   and for each level (from the top down) the height (km), 
   pressure (mb), temperature (K), mixing ratio of water vapor and ozone.
 <LI> The absorption coefficients: each line contains the
   band number, level number (from top down), and k's for the g's.
