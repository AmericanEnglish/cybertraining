<H2>SHDOM: List of Variables</H2>

<PRE>
The following is a list of important variables.

  Variables       Description/Comments

        First the variables used in the adaptive cell structure:
NPTS           total number of grid points
NCELLS         total number of cells
GRIDPOS(3,IP)  x,y,z coordinate values of grid point locations
GRIDPTR(8,IC)  pointer to 8 grid points belonging to a cell.
                 Order of pointers is based on binary digits zyx:
                 IOCT = 1 + BITX + 2*BITY + 4*BITZ, where 
                 BITc is 0 for negative side and 1 for positive side.
NEIGHPTR(6,IC) pointer to 6 neighboring cells of a cell.
                 Order of pointers are -X,+X,-Y,+Y,-Z,+Z (1-6).
                 Is 0 if there is no neighbor cell (boundary).
                 Is positive if there is just one cell across face
                 of current cell (unique neighbor).  Is negative
                 (-index) if there is more than one cell across 
                 the face of current cell.  In this case the
                 cell pointed to is the parent cell that has a 
                 has same or larger face adjoining current cell.
TREEPTR(2,IC)  pointer to parent and children cells in tree structure.
                 First is pointer to parent cell, 0 for a base cell.
                 Second is pointer to first of the two children cells.
                 This pointer is 0 if there are no children cells.
                 The children cells are in successive order, with
                 the negative side first.  See CELLFLAGS for direction
                 of division of split.
CELLFLAGS(IC)  a collection of binary flags for the cells:

                   1  Do independent pixel for Y
