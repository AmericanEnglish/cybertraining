<H2>SHDOM: Choosing Inputs </H2>


See Unix scripts included with the distribution for examples of running
SHDOM.  Also read propgen.txt for how to prepare optical property files.
<P>

The main difficulties in choosing parameters is determining the desired
tradeoff between accuracy and computation cost.  The angular resolution
parameters (NMU, NPHI, SHACC) and the spatial resolution parameters (NX,
NY, NZ, SPLITACC) are the primary ones that determine both the accuracy
and the running time.  See 
 <A HREF="accuracy.html" target=right> Accuracy Issues  </A> 
 for a discussion of this.  NMU must be even (rounded up internally). 
For NPHI greater than about 14, SHDOM will run faster if NPHI has small
prime factors, due to the FFT part of the spherical harmonic transform. 
The base grid size is often the same size as the property grid, but can
have more grid points for higher spatial resolution or even can have
less grid points than the property grid. <P>

PROPFILE always needs to be specified, but INSAVEFILE and OUTSAVEFILE 
seldom do, and CKDFILE is only for doing a k-distribution.  SFCFILE is
given for a surface with variable albedo or temperature, but otherwise
is NONE or NO.
<P>

Set BCFLAG=0 for periodic boundary conditions, and BCFLAG=3 for open
boundary conditions. See
 <A HREF="boundarys.html" target=right> Boundary Conditions </A>
section for explanation.
<P>

Set IPFLAG=0 for normal radiative transfer. IPFLAG=3 is for the
independent pixel approximation.  The independent scanline approximation
is 2D radiative transfer in the solar plane for a 3D medium; it can be
chosen by setting the solar azimuth to 0 and IPFLAG=2 (or SOLARAZ=90
degrees and IPFLAG=1).  Bit 2 of IPFLAG can be set to try an
approximation where the direct beam is computed in 3D, but the diffuse
transfer is done on indendent pixels or 2D slices.  Note, IPFLAG=4 is
the same as IPFLAG=0.
<P>

Generally for solar (collimated) problems with highly peaked phase
functions DELTAM should be set to True; this is because the phase
function must be truncated because a limited number of discrete
ordinates can be used.
<P>

If you want the internal base grid to have the same height levels as the
input property grid then GRIDTYPE='P'. This option allows the vertical
grid spacing to be nonuniform, e.g. more in a cloud layer and less in 
clear sky.  Another way to have the vertical base grid not be uniform is
the GRIDTYPE='F' (file) option which will read the Z levels free format
from a file with the name "zgrid.inp".  The other alternative is to
have the base grid levels evenly spaced between the bottom and top of
the domain (first and last level in property grid).  For an even grid
GRIDTYPE='E', but keep in mind that there are NZ-1 grid cells, so that
for doubling the vertical resolution use NZ=2*(NZP-1)+1 where NZP is
the number of grid points vertically in the property file.
<P>


The SKYRAD parameter is usually 0, but is nonzero when the problem
includes diffuse radiation incident on the top boundary.  This could be
the cosmic background radiation for microwave wavelengths, or diffuse
skylight for solar problems where the domain top is actually in the
lower atmosphere.
<P>

The UNITS parameter is only relevant for thermal emission without a
k-distribution.
<P>

The solution acceleration is usually turned on (ACCELFLAG=.TRUE.). 
If the number of iterations is small because the problem is optically
thin or highly absorbing, then the sequence acceleration can be turned
off, and the memory for the DELSOURCE array freed up (by giving the array
a length of 1).
<P>

The solution accuracy (SOLACC) is the rms change in the source function
during an iteration normalized by the rms of the source function.  There
is no need to make this much, much smaller than the general level of
accuracy (related to the spatial and angular resolution). Because it is
the rms change in an iteration, it should be smaller than the desired
accuracy. Try starting with SOLACC=1E-4.  
<P>

See section on
 <A HREF="arrays.html" target=right> Array Sizes and Memory Management </A>
for how to choose the
four memory parameters (MAX_TOTAL_MB, ADAPT_GRID_FACTOR,
NUM_SH_TERM_FACTOR, CELL_TO_POINT_RATIO) used in shdom90.f90 or to
adjust the array sizes in shdom.f to accomodate your problem size and
computer memory.  The four memory parameters do not affect the SHDOM
solution (unless SHDOM runs out of memory); they only control the array
sizes.
 <P>


See section on 
 <A HREF="propertyfiles.html" target=right>Property File Format  </A>
 for how the medium properties are input.  The medium properties are
specified at points on a grid and are assumed to vary linearly in
between.  This is different from how Monte Carlo radiative transfer
codes usually define the medium, which is by grid cells of uniform
properties.  The medium properties in the model vary trilinearly across
the grid cells.  The internal representation of the medium (on the base
grid) is trilinearly interpolated from the input properties of the
medium.  So if a sharp boundary is desired in the medium (e.g. at cloud
top) it is a good idea to have the two different optical properties
(e.g. cloud and clear) specified at two very close grid levels. 
Otherwise the linear interpolation of the medium will smear the
transition over the resolution of the input property file  (nature is
seldom perfectly sharp).
