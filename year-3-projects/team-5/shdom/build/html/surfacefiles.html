<H2>SHDOM: Surface File Format</H2>

    There are currently four types of surface property files:  
Lambertian, Fresnel, RPV, and Ocean.   The file format allows the
temperature and reflection properties to vary arbitrarily across the
surface.  The surface properties are specified on a regular, evenly
spaced grid.  There should be Nx*Ny points in the surface file.  The
properties are bilinearly interpolated to the domain bottom grid point
locations.  The surface domain is also periodic in X and Y, so that the
domain is delX*Nx by delY*Ny in size.  Thus there are Nx cells across,
and the routine that reads in the surface properties assigns the
properties of the left side of the domain (IX=1) to the right side of
the last cell (IX=NX+1).  A uniform surface can be specified by having
Nx=1 and Ny=1 and making delX and delY large enough to cover the whole
domain.

  The Lambertian surface file format is as follows:
 <PRE>
    L
    Nx  Ny   delX  delY
    IX IY  SfcTemp SfcAlbedo  
      . . .
 </PRE>

<P>
  The Fresnel surface is specified with the complex index of refraction of
the dielectric surface (Mre, Mim):
 <PRE>
    F
    Nx  Ny   delX  delY
    IX IY  SfcTemp  Mre  Mim
      . . .
 </PRE>

<P>
  The RPV surface is specified with three parameters (rho0, k, Theta):
 <PRE>
    R
    Nx  Ny   delX  delY
    IX IY  SfcTemp  rho0  k  Theta
      . . .
 </PRE>

<P>
  The Ocean surface is specified with the near surface wind speed (m/s)
and the chlorophyl-alpha pigment concentration (mg/m^3): 
 <PRE>
    O
    Nx  Ny   delX  delY
    IX IY  SfcTemp  WindSpeed  PigmentConc
      . . .
 </PRE>
The IX and IY are the surface grid numbers (1 to Nx, 1 to Ny).  The surface
temperature is specified in Kelvin.
