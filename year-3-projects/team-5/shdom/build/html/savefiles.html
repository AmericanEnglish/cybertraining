<H2>SHDOM: Binary Save Files</H2>

    The source function solution and associated state may be saved in
binary files.  The adaptive grid cell structure, the source function,
upwelling and downwelling fluxes, and lowest order terms of the
spherical harmonic radiance field are stored.  These files can be
used to continue a run to higher accuracy or to save the solution
so more output files can be generated (e.g. radiances at more angles).
For a k-distribution, the input save file is used for the first k and 
the output save file is from last k.
