<H2>SHDOM: Source Code Options</H2>

This is a list of options in the operation of SHDOM that one may select
by making trivial code changes.  Except for selecting the NAMELIST
option, choosing netcdf property file input, adding a new surface type,
the higher order radiance terms, or turning on processor load balancing,
most of these would only be changed to experiment with the operation of
the SHDOM algorithm.
<P>

    Namelist input: main program (shdom.f or shdom90.f90); Comment out
the call to USER_INPUT and uncomment the call to NAMELIST_INPUT.  
<P>

    NetCDF property file input: main program (shdom90.f90); Comment out
calls to READ_PROPERTY_SIZE, and READ_PROPERTIES and uncomment calls to
read_property_size_netcdf and read_properties_netcdf.  Use the makefile
to compile with the netcdf library.
<P>

    Adding surface reflection types: in shdomsub2.f write a BRDF
Fortran function modeled on RPV_REFLECTION and add a call in
SURFACE_BRDF to the new function.  If it is a specular type, update
SPECULAR_SURFACE.  In shdomsub3.f modify subroutine READ_SURFACE by
adding a block to read in the new surface type parameters.
<P>

    Output rms of higher order radiance spherical harmonic terms:      
at top of main program (shdom.f); set HIGHORDERRAD=.TRUE. for outputing
the rms of the higher order radiance terms (above L=1,M=1) normalized by
the mean radiance (S output mode).  This is useful for determining
regions in the diffusion domain, where the higher order terms are zero.
Make sure to change the declaration SUMSHTERMS(4*MAXIG) in shdom.f
to SUMSHTERMS(5*MAXIG) to make room for the extra term.  Since all the
radiance spherical harmonic terms are kept the running time may be
somewhat longer, and the memory use (RADIANCE array) can be much larger.
<P>

    Discrete ordinate angle set: SOLVE_RTE (shdomsub1.f); The ORDINATESET
variable before call to MAKE_ANGLE_SET is the type of angle set: 1 - full
Gaussian set, 2 - reduced Gaussian set (default), 3 - reduced double Gaussian.
Using the double Gaussian angular set will give more accurate hemispheric
fluxes, e.g. from a Lambertian surface.
<P>

    Multiple processor load balancing: Change LoadBalance=.TRUE. at the
beginning of shdom_mpi.f90 (see the last paragraph of the multiple
processing section).
<P>

    k-distribution initialization: at top of main program (shdom.f); 
Change BASEOUT = .TRUE. to initiatize with and output only the base
grid during the iteration over k's, rather than the default of
initializing with the previous k's adaptive grid structure.
<P>

    Cell splitting scheduling: SOLVE_RTE (shdomsub1.f); The range of 
solution criterion during which the adaptive grid cell splitting occurs
can be chosen by changing ENDADAPTSOL and STARTADAPTSOL; other aspects
of the scheduling can be changed as well.
<P>
    Adaptive grid smoothing: SPLIT_GRID (shdomsub1.f); The call to 
subroutine GRID_SMOOTH_TEST may be commented out to stop the adaptive
grid smoothing. This will produce somewhat fewer adaptive cells, but
make a somewhat more irregular grid.
<P>
    Cell splitting visualization: SOLVE_RTE (shdomsub1.f); The
subroutine VISUALIZE_CELLS may be commented in after the solution loop
to produce  a GLE graphics file showing the adaptive cell structure. 
This can be changed easily for other graphics languagues.  The
subroutine OUTPUT_CELL_SPLIT may be commented in to output the medium
extinction and adaptive cell splitting criterion for X, Y, and Z.
<P>

    Cutoff transmission for back tracing: PATH_INTEGRATION (shdomsub1.f); 
The TRANSMIN variable can be changed (e.g. from 1.0 to 0.1) to have the
back ray tracing continue until the specified transmission is reached.
This can eliminate the grid radiance interpolation error, but can take
much more CPU time.
