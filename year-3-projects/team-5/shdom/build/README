This tar file contains the Spherical Harmonic Discrete Ordinate Method
(SHDOM) radiative transfer model written by Frank Evans at the
University of Colorado.  This model computes unpolarized monochromatic
or spectral band radiative transfer in a one, two, or three-dimensional
medium for either collimated solar and/or thermal emission sources of
radiation.  The model is written in a variant of Fortran 77 and parts
are also in Fortran90.  The distribution also contains Fortran 90
programs for generating the optical property files input to SHDOM from
physical properties of water and ice cloud particles and aerosols.  Two
k-distribution parameterizations are included for performing broadband
shortwave and longwave radiative transfer.

The distribution is available from http://nit.colorado.edu.  This Web
site also contains results of validation testing, examples useful for
learning how to run the model, and a PDF version of journal articles.
