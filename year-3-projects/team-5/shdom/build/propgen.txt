            SHDOM Property File Generation System


The optical property file generation system for SHDOM has been upgraded
to be more flexible and accurate.  Instead of the cloudprp program,
there are now three Fortran 90 programs: make_mie_table.f90 and
make_ice_table.f90 for making scattering tables and propgen.f90 for
generating the property file from a particle properties file.  The
particle properties file specifies the mass content (g/m^3) and
effective radius (microns) of each particle component at each grid
point.  The make_mie_table program generates scattering tables for gamma
or lognormal size distributions of spherical particles, while
make_ice_table generates scattering tables in the shortwave for gamma
distributions of one of eight ice crystal shapes using Ping Yang's
single scattering properties.  The program plotscattab.f90 makes a
plotting file of phase functions versus angle from the Legendre series
in a scattering table file.  The propgen program allows an arbitrary
mixture of any number of pure components at each grid point.  The
extinction and single scattering albedo from all the components are
combined exactly, while phase functions existing in the scattering
tables and newly created phase functions are chosen so that the phase
function error is smaller than user specified tolerances. The result is
a tabulated phase function format property file for SHDOM with a small
as possible memory requirement that closely approximates the desired
optical property distribution.


The example Unix script "run_propgen_example" shows how to make
scattering tables and run propgen to generate a property file for SHDOM.
Scattering tables are made at two wavelengths for lognormal
distributions of spherical dust aerosols, gamma distributions of cloud
water droplets, and gamma distributions of plate and rough aggregate ice
crystals.  The example particle file "nauru19990707.part" specifies the
mass content and effective radius distributions for a horizontally
uniform aerosol layer (particle type 1) from the surface to 1.4 km, a
broken cumulus water cloud layer (type 2) from 0.59 to 2.03 km, and a
cirrus layer made of plates and aggregates (types 3 and 4) from 8.75 to
14.75 km.  The two-dimensional (X-Z) cumulus and cirrus cloud
distributions are derived from the ARM millimeter-wave cloud radar on
Nauru Island.  The distribution includes an IDL program
"plot_propgen_example.pro" which plots the components of the particle
file, the resulting extinction and single scattering fields, and
radiance output from SHDOM (requires other IDL files in the SHDOM
distribution).



                       MAKE_MIE_TABLE

Make_mie_table calculates the single scattering properties of gamma or
lognormal distributions of spherical particles and outputs the results
in a scattering table.  If the particle type is water or ice then an
integration across the specified wavelength band may be performed.  If
an aerosol particle type is chosen then the index of refraction of the
aerosol is specified.

For water or ice particles an integration across the wavelength range
may be done.  In this case a series of Mie calculations are performed at
a specified wavelength spacing using the correct index of refraction for
each wavelength.  The alternative is to use the Planck function averaged
index of refraction and central wavelength, which takes less computation
but may be less accurate (depending on the spectral band width).  For
solar wavelengths (< 3 um) the Planck function is for a solar
temperature (5800 K), for longwave wavelengths (> 5 um) the Planck
function is for an atmospheric temperature (270 K), while between 3 and
5 um a straight average is used.

If an aerosol particle type is chosen then the particle bulk density of
the aerosol is specified.  The density is needed because the output
scattering table extinction is normalized for a mass content of 1 g/m^3.

The gamma distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r)
 where r is the droplet radius, and a, b, alpha specify the gamma
distribution.  The number concentration of droplets is 
 N = a Gamma(alpha+1)/ b^(alpha+1), where Gamma is the gamma function.
The effective radius of the distribution is r_eff = (alpha+3)/b, while
the effective variance is v_eff = 1/(alpha+3).  A typical value for 
water clouds is v_eff=0.1 or alpha=7.  For ice clouds a typical value is
alpha=1 or 2.  An exponential distribution is obtained with alpha=0.  A
large value of alpha gives close to a monodisperse distribution.

The lognormal distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a/r exp( -[ln(r/r0)]^2 / (2*sigma^2) )
 where r0 is the logarithmic mode of the distribution and sigma is the
standard deviation of the log.  The number concentration of droplets is
N = sqrt(2*pi)*sigma*a.  The effective radius of the distribution is
r_eff = r0*exp(2.5*sigma^2) and the effective variance of the
distribution is v_eff = exp(sigma^2)-1.  A common value for water clouds
is sigma=.35, or v_eff=0.130, and a common value for aerosol distributions
is sigma=0.7.

The maximum radius of the distribution is specified by the user because
it is the critical determinant of the Mie calculation computer time.
There are often microphysical reasons for truncating the theoretical
size distribution; for example, one might say that the cloud droplet
mode ends at a radius of 50 microns.  For a narrow gamma distribution
(alpha=7) of cloud droplets, a maximum radius of only twice the largest
effective radius gives virtually the same optical properties as the 
untruncated gamma distribution.  For a wide lognormal distribution, as
might be used for an aerosol distribution, a much larger maximum radius
relative to the largest effective radius would be required if no
truncation was desired.  If there is truncation make_mie_table uses an
iterative procedure to adjust the size distribution modal radius to
achieve the desired effective radius.  Thus one can be assured that the
size distributions have the effective radii reported in the output
scattering table even if there is truncation of the theoretical
distribution.  The number and spacing of the integration steps over the
size distribution is controlled by the GET_NSIZE and GET_SIZES
subroutines.  The default formula is DELX = max(0.01,0.03*X**0.5),
where X is the size parameter (2*pi*r/lambda, lambda=wavelength)
and DELX is the integration step.  This integration spacing is
adequate for most purposes, but can be easily changed if higher
accuracy is sought.

                     MAKE_ICE_TABLE

Make_ice_table calculates the shortwave single scattering properties of
gamma distributions of one of eight shapes of ice crystals and outputs
the results in a scattering table.  The ice crystal scattering properties
were produced by Ping Yang and are described in this article:
   Yang, Ping,  K. N. Liou, Klaus Wyser, David Mitchell, 2000:
   Parameterization of the scattering and absorption properties of
   individual ice crystals.  J. Geophys. Res., 105 (D4), 4699-4718.
 The scattering properties are tabulated for 56 wavelength bands from
0.20 to 5.0 microns and 24 particle lengths from 3 to 3500 microns. The
eight ice crystal shapes are 1=hollow column, 2=solid column, 3=plate,
4=dendrite, 5=rough aggregate, 6=smooth aggregate, 7=4-bullet rosette,
and 8=6-bullet rosette (see the article for pictures of these shapes).

The phase functions have been modified for this distribution by 
convolving the portions with scattering angles less than 10 degrees by a
gaussian with 0.25 degree rms width and by adjusting the forward peak
height to normalize each phase function.  The reasons for doing this is
that the original phase functions with the largest size parameters would
require a huge number of Legendre series terms to be represented for
SHDOM and also were not properly normalized.  The number of Legendre
terms required for the smoothed forward peak phase functions is 2500.
The smoothing of the forward peak will not affect the radiative transfer
results significantly for nearly all applications (one application where
it could be an issue is sun photometry, but the TMS approximation in
SHDOM is already poor for that application).  

These phase functions do not contain the "delta transmission", which is
the direct transmission of rays through parallel faces of ice crystals. 
The extinction efficiency, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry
parameter have thus been delta rescaled to be consistent.  This reduces
the extinction efficiency, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry
parameter from the values in Ping Yang's original data.  The extinction
efficiency is well below 2 for crystals with parallel faces, such as
plates and solid columns.

The modified Ping Yang ice scattering data is stored in the file
"sw_ice_scatter.db".  This ascii file contains a header with useful
information, followed by the data with one line per particle shape,
wavelength, and particle size.  Each line contains the following
columns: 
 Heading     Explanation
 S          shape index (1 to 8)
 Wave1      starting wavelength of band (microns)
 Wave2      ending wavelength of band (microns)
 Wavcen     center wavelength of band (microns)
 IndexRe    real part of index of refraction
 IndexIm    imaginary part of index of refraction
 SolarWt    fraction of solar flux in wavelength band
 ParLength  particle length (maximum extent) (microns)
 ParDarea   equivalent area spherical diameter (microns)
 ParDvol    equivalent volume spherical diameter (microns)
 Qext       extinction efficiency
 SSalb      single-scattering albedo
 Asym       asymmetry factor
 Phasefunc  phase function at 288 angles stored in a compressed format

The log of the phase function values are stored in three digit base 95
(there are 95 printable characters in ascii).  If the three characters
of the base 95 number are represented by Cn (i.e. C1,C2,C3) then the
base 95 digits are Dn=ICHAR(Cn)-32, and the phase function value are
10**(10*(D1/95+D2/95**2+D3/95**3)-4).  This helps to compress the 
original 152 million bytes of ice scattering data down to only 10
millions bytes.

Make_ice_table reads the "sw_ice_scatter.db" database file to produce a
scattering table file for gamma size distributions with a sequence of
effective radii for one particle shape (i.e. it does not allow particle
mixtures).  The single scattering properties are averaged over the
specified wavelength range using a solar temperature (5800 K) Planck
function weighting.  The program prints out the database bands and
weightings that are used.  The gamma distributions are in terms of the
equivalent volume spherical diameter (Dv), not the particle length.  The
"b" parameter of the gamma distribution [n(D) = a Dv^alpha exp(-b*Dv)]
is adjusted iteratively to achieve the correct effective radius.  The
effective radius is defined as one half the ratio of the third moment of
Dv to the second moment of Da (the equivalent area spherical diameter).
The user specified effective radius may not be achievable for a
particular particle shape and size distribution width, in which case a
different range of effective radius or a narrower distribution (larger
alpha) will have to be chosen.  The extinction in the output scattering
table is normalized for distributions with an ice water content of      
1 g/m^3 assuming an ice density of 0.916 g/cm^3.


                   Input Parameters

Parameter   Description
ICESCATDB   filename of the ice scattering database (i.e. sw_ice_scatter.db)
WAVELEN1    wavelength range (microns) for this band
WAVELEN2       for monochromatic choose WAVELEN1=WAVELEN2

                        PROPGEN

Propgen generates an optical property file for SHDOM from a particle
property file specifying the 3D distribution of mass content and
effective radius for several types of particles.  The optical properties
for these particle types are specified in scattering table files.  The
optical properties are interpolated in effective radius within the
scattering tables (logarithmically for extinction and linearly for
single scattering albedo and phase function).  The extinction and
single scattering albedo for the mixture specified at each grid point
are calculated exactly.  The phase functions for the mixtures are
approximate, however, because there is not enough memory to store a
phase function for each grid point.  Instead, the closest phase function
to the correct one is used.  If none of the phase functions in the
scattering tables are within the user specified tolerances then the new
mixture phase function is added to the list.  Tolerances are specified
for the asymmetry parameter and the maximum fractional error in phase
function values.

There are three parameters that control the creation of new phase
functions.  The first is the maximum number of phase functions that may
be created, which is designed to limit the memory use by SHDOM.  The
second and third parameters are the tolerance in asymmetry parameter
error and the tolerance in maximum fractional error in phase function
values.  The maximum fractional phase function error is calculated at 90
angles from 2 to 180 degrees, but this can be changed by changing the
 "INTEGER, PARAMETER :: NANGLES=90" statement in propgen.f90.  Smaller
values of the two tolerances will produce a more accurate property file,
but at the expense of a larger number of phase functions.  If the
property file is to be used only for flux computations then the
asymmetry parameter tolerance is most important and the fractional phase
function tolerance can be set large.  If the property file is to be
used for radiance calculations then the fractional error in phase
function tolerance is more important.  If you are outputting a
one-dimensional property file, then you can set the tolerances to zero
to get one phase function for each output level (actually the program
has minimum values of 0.002 for the asymmetry parameter tolerance and
0.01 for the fractional phase function tolerance).  Propgen only outputs
the phase functions actually used in the property file, not all the ones
in the scattering tables (like cloudprp did).  If 1000 or more phase 
functions are going to be output then the format statement in subroutine
OUTPUT_PROPERTIES will need to be changed.

In addition to the scattering properties from the input particles,
propgen also calculates and includes molecular Rayleigh scattering.  The
use specifies a Rayleigh scattering coefficient, which depends on
wavelength (or the user may wish to simply set to zero for some
applications).  The amount of molecular scattering depends on the air
density.  Hence for a particular solar wavelength band a coefficient (k)
may be defined which gives the extinction from the air pressure (p) and
temperature (T):  ext = k p/T.  The Rayleigh scattering coefficient
input to propgen may be derived from the molecular Rayleigh scattering
optical depth.  The Rayleigh optical depth at sea level as a function of
wavelength (lambda in micron) is 
    tau = 0.0088*lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
From this formula the propgen Rayleigh input coefficient is
    k = (2.97E-4 K mb^-1 km^-1) lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
Propgen uses the hypsometric relation to calculate the pressure profile
from the input temperature profile.

Typically the high resolution cloud field occupies only small portion of
the atmospheric profile and the other height levels are used to fill in
the rest of the atmosphere.  The other height levels should be chosen
according to the needs of SHDOM and the molecular absorption profile. 
SHDOM needs some vertical resolution to resolve the radiance field.  If
molecular Rayleigh scattering is significant, then the other levels
must exist in clear sky to put that scattering in the property file. 
Similarly, if a k-distribution file is giving the molecular absorption,
then other levels must cover the range where the absorption is
significant.  For example, stratospheric levels need to be included for
ozone absorption in the ultraviolet.


                     Particle Properties File

The particle file specifies the three-dimensional distribution of mass
content (g/m^3) and effective radius (microns) for each component type
of particle.  Only the the particle types with nonzero mass content need
to be specified at each grid point.  The particle file is an ascii text
file with the following format:
   3            [format type]
   Nx Ny Nz     [number of X, Y, Z grid points]
   delX delY    [X and Y grid spacing in km]   
   Z1 ... Zn    [heights of particle levels in km]
   T1 ... Tn    [temperatures in Kelvin at these levels]
   IX IY IZ  Numcomp  Type1 Mass1 Reff1 ... TypeN MassN ReffN
    . . .
 Numcomp is the number of particle components, Type? are the type
numbers of the components, Mass? are the mass contents [g/m^3] of the
components, and Reff? are the effective radii [microns] of the
components.  See file "nauru19990707.part" in the distribution for an
example particle file.  In addition to this new particle file format,
propgen can read the old 2 parameter LWC files that cloudprp used.

                  Scattering Table Format

The scattering tables have a six line header.  Propgen only reads the
wavelength range in the second header line and the number of effective
radii on the sixth header line.  After the header, for each effective
radius entry in a scattering table, there is one line with the effective
radius, the volume extinction coefficient (km^-1 for a mass content of 1
g/m^3), the single scattering albedo, and the order (Nleg) of the
Legendre series of the phase function.  The next line or several lines
contain the Nleg+1 Legendre series coefficients, starting with chi0
(which must be equal to 1).  For an example scattering table, see one
of the scattering table files produced by the example script.  Propgen
can read the Mie tables produced by cloudprp if the wavelength range is
put in the second line (instead of just the central wavelength) using a
text editor.

                        PLOTSCATTAB

Plotscattab calculates phase functions as a function of scattering angle
from a scattering table produced by make_mie_table or make_ice_table or
from the tabulated phase functions in a property file.  The scattering
tables and property files stores the phase function as a Legendre
series, so plotscattab sums the Legendre series for a specified number
of discrete scattering angles.  Several phase function for different
effective radius may be selected for conversion.  A graphing program can
be used to plot the output of plotscattab.  

               Plotting file format

The output file from plotmietab contains a three line header and then
the phase functions in separate columns.  The phase function output
format is:
 !  Scattering table phase functions: water_w164c.scat 
 ! Angle cos(angle)  Phase functions for effective radii (um) 
 !                      5.00       10.00       15.00       20.00

                           CLOUDPRP


Cloudprp is now considered obsolete, but is included in the distribution
for those that may prefer to keep using it or don't have a Fortran 90
compiler.  It has not been modified for this distribution, and is no
longer supported.  Since it lacks the adaptive tabulated phase function
algorithm of propgen, it is also less accurate.

Cloudprp prepares SHDOM properties files for 3D cloud fields.  The cloud
field is input with a 3D grid of liquid water content and (optionally)
droplet effective radius.  A tabulated phase function property file for
a particular wavelength is produced using Mie scattering from gamma
distributions or lognormal distributions of cloud droplets. The cloud
layer may occupy only part of the output domain, in which case the other
height levels are specified.  A vertical profile of horizontally uniform
aerosol scattering may be specified.  The aerosol properties (0.55 um
extinction, effective radius, distribution width, and index of
refraction at 0.55 um and the desired wavelenth) are input from a file
as a function of height.  The aerosol optical properties are calculated
with Mie theory and molecular Rayleigh scattering is included.

Compiling cloudprp:
  f77 -O -o cloudprp  cloudprp.f mieindsub.f

There are two modes of operation to cloudprp.  One is for making a Mie
scattering table of cloud optical properties.  The other mode is to use
a Mie table to produce an SHDOM property file.  Because the Mie
computations are time consuming it is useful to save these scattering
tables.  A Mie table lists the scattering properties (extinction,
single scattering albedo, Legendre series coefficients for the phase
function) as a function of droplet effective radius for a particular
wavelength and gamma distribution width parameter.  The table is
made for a liquid water content of 1 g/m^3 and is easily scaled to
other LWCs.

Although the Mie calculations are done for a single wavelength, the 
wavelength range for a band is input.  This is for performing a spectral
integration across a band using a k-distribution for molecular
absorption.  If a range of wavelengths are input then the central
wavelength is chosen by a weighted average using a Planck function.
For solar wavelengths (< 4 um) the Planck function is for a solar
temperature (5800 K), while for longer wavelengths an atmospheric
temperature (270 K) is used.  A weighted averaged is similarly done to
define the band averaged index of refraction.  The PARTTYPE='A' option
allow one to make Mie tables and property files with a user specified
index of refraction, such as for dirty cloud droplets, aerosols, etc.

The gamma distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r)
 where r is the droplet radius, and a, b, alpha specify the gamma
distribution.  The number concentration of droplets is 
 N = a Gamma(alpha+1)/ b^(alpha+1), where Gamma is the gamma function.
The effective radius of the distribution is r_eff = (alpha+3)/b, while
the effective variance is v_eff = 1/(alpha+3).  A typical value for 
water clouds is v_eff=0.1 or alpha=7.  For ice clouds a typical value
is alpha=1.  An exponential distribution is obtained with alpha=0.  
A large value of alpha gives close to a monodisperse distribution.

The lognormal distribution of cloud droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a/r exp( -[ln(r/r0)]^2 / (2*sigma^2) )
 where r0 is the logarithmic mode of the distribution and sigma is the
standard deviation of the log.  The number concentration of droplets is
N = sqrt(2*pi)*sigma*a.  The effective radius of the distribution is
r_eff = r0*exp(2.5*sigma^2) and the effective variance of the
distribution is v_eff = exp(sigma^2)-1.  A common value for water clouds
is sigma=.35, or v_eff=0.130.

The cloud optical properties depend on the index of refraction and the
gamma distribution of cloud droplets.  The index of refraction of either
water or ice is obtained from subroutines in the program and averaged
over the wavelength range as described above.  The width parameter of
the gamma distribution, alpha, is given in the Mie table.  The other
parameters of the gamma distribution are determined from the cloud
liquid water content and the effective radius.  These are either both
specified in the cloud LWC file or determined from the LWC.  If only the
LWC is in the cloud file then the droplet number concentration is
assumed to be constant and the effective radius is calculated.

In order to save computing time, the integration over the droplet size
distribution does not fully resolve the Mie scattering function. For
large size parameters this may cause some small spurious wiggles on the
phase function.  If these bother you, then change the spacing (DELX)
in MAKE_MIE_TABLE.  Also the Mie code used does not determine if
an integration point lands on a resonance spike, and so there is
a small chance that this could effect the results in a minor
way for nonabsorbing wavelengths.

The number of Legendre series terms needed for the phase function
depends on the effective size parameter (x_eff = 2 pi r_eff/lambda) of
the droplet size distribution.  For visible wavelengths more than 1000
terms may be needed for a fully converged series.  For some radiative
transfer applications (outputting only fluxes in solar or for any
thermal radiative transfer) a truncation of the series may be desired.
The MAXTABLEG and MAXOUTLEG input parameters allow one to control
how many Legendre terms are output.

Rayleigh scattering coefficient:  The molecular scattering coefficient
depends on the air density.  Hence for a particular solar wavelength
band a coefficient (k) may be defined which gives the extinction from
the air pressure (p) and temperature (T):  ext = k p/T.  The Rayleigh
scattering coefficient input to cloudprp may be derived from the
molecular Rayleigh scattering optical depth.  The Rayleigh optical depth
at sea level as a function of wavelength (lambda in micron) is 
    tau = 0.0088*lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)
From this formula the cloudprp Rayleigh input coefficient is 
    k = (2.97E-4 K mb^-1 km^-1) lambda**(-4.15+0.2*lambda)

Typically the high resolution cloud field occupies only small portion of
the atmospheric profile and the other height levels are used to fill in
the rest of the atmosphere. The other height levels should be chosen
according to the needs of SHDOM, the aerosol profile, and the molecular
absorption profile.  SHDOM needs some vertical resolution to resolve the
radiance field.  If aerosols or molecular Rayleigh scattering are
significant, then the other levels must exist in clear sky to put that
scattering in the property file.  Similarly, if a k-distribution file is
giving the molecular absorption, then other levels must cover the range
where the absorption is significant. For example, stratospheric levels
need to be included for ozone absorption in the visible.


                      Cloud LWC File

The cloud LWC file specifies the three-dimensional distribution of 
cloud liquid water content (g/m^3) and (optionally) the droplet
effective radius (micron).  There are thus two types of cloud LWC
files: 1 parameter and 2 parameter files.  The cloud LWC file is
an ascii text file with the following format;
   type         [1 or 2, for LWC only or LWC and Reff]
   Nx Ny Nz     [number of X, Y, Z grid points]
   delX delY    [X and Y grid spacing in km]
   Z1 ... Zn    [heights of cloud levels in km]
   T1 ... Tn    [temperatures in Kelvin]
  IX IY IZ LWC        [for 1 parameter file, for each grid point]
    . . .
  IX IY IZ LWC Reff   [for 2 parameter file]
    . . .

See the "les2y21.lwc" file in the distribution for an example cloud LWC file.


                    Aerosol Property File

The aerosol property file specifies the (usually coarse) vertical
distribution of aerosol properties.  Simply input 'NONE' for the aerosol
file name if no aerosols are desired.  There must be at least two levels
in the file.  The format is ascii text with the following columns:

   Height,  Extinction,  Eff. Radius,  alpha/sigma, Index of refraction
            at 0.55 um                              at 0.55 um and wavelenth
    (km)     (km^-1)      (micron)

The levels must be increasing in height.  The aerosol extinction and
single scattering albedo are interpolated between the input levels. The
aerosol input level closest to the property file level is chosen for the
combined aerosol/Rayleigh phase function.  Property file heights outside
the aerosol file range use the closest (first or last) aerosol level.
The aerosol distribution width parameter is either "alpha" for a gamma
distribution or "sigma" for a lognormal distribution (same as for the
the cloud input described before).
  The index of refraction and effective radius of the aerosols depends
on their composition (e.g. sea salt, mineral, sulfate), degree of
hydration, and wavelength.
 An example aerosol file is given below (it has a total 0.55 micron
optical depth of 0.4): 
   0.0   0.10   0.9  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
   2.0   0.10   0.9  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
   4.0   0.02   0.6  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
  12.0   0.00   0.6  0.7   1.5 -0.01  1.5 -0.02
 Note that this calculation is for a more absorbing wavelength, for
which the imaginary part of the index of refraction is larger than at
0.55 microns.
